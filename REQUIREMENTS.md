2. **Failed Booking Due to Unavailability**
    - Given a passenger selects a flight
    - But there are no available seats on the flight
    - When the passenger attempts to book
    - Then the system should notify the passenger of the unavailability.
3. **Failed Booking Due to System Error**
    - Given a passenger selects a flight
